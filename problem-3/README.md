The changes I have made to the extension are:
1. Added a 5 second wait timer before running my function so that the original extension still operates
2. In my newly added function, all content of the body is wiped, a new image element and div element are added with some styling along with a reset button.
3. For the reset button, I have the original DOM state of the body element saved when the page is loaded, then when the reset button is clicked, it triggers a function which sets the body back to it's original content.
